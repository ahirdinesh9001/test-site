    <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.</p>
    <p> HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.</p>
    <p>The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, and can make font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
